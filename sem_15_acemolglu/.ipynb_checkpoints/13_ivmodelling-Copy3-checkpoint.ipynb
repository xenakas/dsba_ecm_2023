    "(i) Suppose a critic asserts the following: â€œSettler mortality is correlated not only with the quality of institutions, but also with the proportion of the population of European origin in a given country (variable euro). Due to the peculiarities of the colonization process in some countries, the proportion of the European population is much higher than that of the indigenous population and sometimes approaches 100 percent. Moreover, this share itself affects the value of GDP: the more people with European origin in the country, the more GDP, even with the same quality of institutions.\"\n",
